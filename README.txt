1. Short description of your app like what is it about, how can I run your app etc.
-  I've created a calculator program that offers four fundamental mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user to input a number from 1 to 5, where 1 represents addition, 2 is for subtraction, 3 signifies multiplication, 4 stands for division, and 5 allows the user to exit the program. Once the user selects a mathematical operation, the program then requests two numbers from the user, performs the chosen operation, and displays the result. This process continues until the user decides to exit by choosing option 5.

- When running the docker image, make sure to type "docker run -i -t sing1822/dockerhub:firstpush" as the program uses a user input.
